# Code of Conduct

## Diversity
We accept others, no matter the gender, nationality, culture, religion.

## Respect
We all have different backgrounds, beliefs, and points of view. We respect all of them.
Treat others as you wish to be treated.

## Trust and Cooperation
We are a team, we don't judge rather support each other.

## Autonomy
Each member of the team is the owner of their tasks. They choose how to do their tasks, when to ask for help, and when to pull the plug on a discussion that they asked for.

## Responsibility
We are individually responsible for our parts of the products. Also, collectively as a team, we all are responsible for the health and features of the whole product.

## Ownership
Each one of us is the owner of their code and/or projects. If something fails, they have to take care of the failure, ensure completeness and ensure the return to full health.

## Healthy Culture of Controversy
It is ok to disagree in a discussion. A healthy culture of controversy includes that everyone's subjective views are equally valid and valuable. When it comes to objective facts, standards, references or pure logic, there is a way to resolve them.

If there is no agreement in the discussion then escalate it to the accountable person or the expert of this field to decide.
In the discussion we need to make sure that every argument has been heard and there is no winner or loser. A discussion shouldn't be about ego.

## Disagree and Commit
It is not always necessary that everyone agrees with everything and everyone else in order to commit to the task. We should discuss it and present our concerns during the discussion, but once committed we ought to deliver the highest quality work, specially in broader and shared tasks.

## Raise the flag
If we feel that something is wrong, we should not be afraid to raise the flag and speak about it. 
We have talk about the things that we don't like. Everyone is equally important for us.
