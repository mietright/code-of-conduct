# Code of Conduct

## Diversity
We accept others, no matter the gender, nationality, culture, religion.

## Respect
We all have different backgrounds, beliefs and points of view.
Treat others as you wish to be treated.

## Trust and Cooperation
We are a team, don't be afraid to be judged. We support each other.

## Autonomy
You are the owner of your task, you choose how to do your tasks , when to ask for help, and when to pull the plug on a discussion that you asked for.

## Responsability
You are responsible for your actions. But as a team, we all are responsible for the product and for what we deploy.

## Ownership
Be the owner of your code and projects.  If something fails on it, you have to take care of it.

## Disagree
In a discussion it is ok to disagree. But a healthy culture of controversy includes, that other points of views next to yours are not only allowed, but as valid and valuable as your own. Additionally the person who works on the task has the right to stop the argument at any time, take an informed decision and continue working.

## Disagree and Commit
Let's commit on what we agree. (please, I need help to finish this one)

## Raise the flag
If you feel that there is something wrong, please raise the flag and speak. Let's have a meeting and talk about the things that you don't like. Your thoughts are important for us.
