We all have different backgrounds, beliefs and points of view.
Treat others as you wish to be treated.

## Trust and Cooperation
We are a team, don't be afraid to be judged. We support each other.

## Autonomy
You are the owner of your task, you choose how to do your tasks , when to ask for help, and when to pull the plug on a discussion that you asked for.

## Responsability
You are responsible for your actions. But as a team, we all are responsible for the product and for what we deploy.

## Ownership
Be the owner of your code and projects.  If something fails on it, you have to take care of it.

## Disagree
You don't have to agree with everything we say, it is ok to disagree, give your arguments and let's set up an agreement.

## Commit
Let's commit on what we agree. (please, I need help to finish this one)

## Raise the flag
If you feel that there is something wrong, please raise the flag and speak. Let's have a meeting and talk about the things that you don't like. Your thoughts are important for us.
