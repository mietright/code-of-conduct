# Code of Conduct

## Diversity
We accept others, no matter the gender, nationality, culture, religion.

## Respect
We all have different backgrounds, beliefs, and points of view. We respect all of them.
Treat others as you wish to be treated.

## Trust and Cooperation
We are on the same team, we do not judge, rather support each other.
Everyone can trust that it is safe to raise concerns and speak up if there is a problem. Everyone can trust that it will be taken seriously and it will not backfire.

Assume the best intentions of your colleagues: social distances due to working remotely can give you the opposite impression.

Everyone can express their opinion without expecting judgment.

We help build up our teammates instead of tearing them down.

### Transparency
We do not hide either information or planning to our teammates regarding the development of our projects and features, weather or not they are part of it.
We do not hide anything to protect our image or keep control of something.
We assume our teammates are entirely transparent with us.

## Autonomy
Each member of the team is the owner of their tasks. They choose how to do their tasks, when to ask for help, and when to pull the plug on a discussion that they asked for.

## Responsibility
We are individually responsible for our parts of the products. Also, collectively as a team, we all are responsible for the health and features of the whole product.

## Ownership
Each one of us is the owner of their code and/or projects. If something fails, they have to take care of the failure, ensure completeness and ensure the return to full health.

## Healthy Culture of Controversy
It is ok to disagree in a discussion. A healthy culture of controversy includes that everyone's views are equally valid and valuable. Although the person who works on the task gets to have the absolute right to stop the argument at any time.

## Disagree and Commit
It is not always necessary that everyone agrees with everything and everyone else in order to commit to the task. We should discuss it and present our concerns during the discussion, but once committed we ought to deliver the highest quality work, specially in broader and shared tasks.

## Raise the flag
If we feel that something is wrong, we should not be afraid to raise the flag and speak about it.
We have talk about the things that we don't like. Everyone is equally important for us.
