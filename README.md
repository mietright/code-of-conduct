# Code of Conduct

## Diversity
We accept others, no matter the gender, nationality, culture, religion.

## Respect
We all have different backgrounds, beliefs, and points of view. We respect all of them.
Treat others as you wish to be treated.

## Work Balance
We don't want to cause burnout in our team.

We need to remember that we are not robots; we shouldn’t load ourselves with more tasks than we can handle.
We should check in with our non-robot teammates to ensure that they too are not overloaded or burning out.

We should foster an environment where it is healthy to speak up about an excessive amount of work.
The Sprint Planning ritual is a good opportunity to talk about task loads and to set healthy expectations about work volume.
We should be careful about setting constantly expanding expectations based on the pace of work: just because the team finised X tickets last sprint does not mean that the right goal is 2X for next sprint.

Although we might have some short bursts of high amounts of work, this should not be the standard.

## Trust and Cooperation
We are on the same team, we do not judge, rather support each other.
Everyone can trust that it is safe to raise concerns and speak up if there is a problem. Everyone can trust that it will be taken seriously and it will not backfire.

Assume the best intentions of your colleagues: social distances due to working remotely can give you a different impression than it was meant.

Everyone can express their opinion without expecting judgment.

We help build up our teammates instead of tearing them down.

### Transparency
We do not hide either information or planning to our teammates regarding the development of our projects and features, whether or not they are part of it.
We do not hide anything to protect our image or keep control of something.
We assume our teammates are entirely transparent with us.

## Autonomy
Each member of the team is the owner of their tasks. They choose how to do their tasks, when to ask for help, and when to pull the plug on a discussion that they asked for.

## Giving and receiving Feedback
If we don’t agree on something, we need to give constructive feedback instead of blaming. On the other hand, we need to be open to receiving feedback or changing if we agree that a change needs to happen.

Remember to always praise in public and correct in private.

## Credits and recognition
Give credits to the original owner for ideas and implementations.
The team should not compete with each other and feel free to share thoughts with confidence.
It includes ideas, design, execution, or any piece of work.

Do not take credit for the idea or implementation of someone else. It is ok to use ideas as a base, but we need to give credit to the owner of the original idea.

### Gratitude
If someone helped us or contributed to something, it would be great if you could give thanks to this person publicly. It is not mandatory to do it, but it will be a nice gesture from your side.

## Responsibility
We are individually responsible for our parts of the products. Also, collectively as a team, we all are responsible for the health and features of the whole product.

## Ownership
Each one of us is the owner of their code and/or projects. If something fails, they have to take care of the failure, ensure completeness and ensure the return to full health.

## Healthy Culture of Controversy
It is ok to disagree in a discussion. A healthy culture of controversy includes that everyone's subjective views are equally valid and valuable. When it comes to objective facts, standards, references or pure logic, there is a way to resolve them.

If there is no agreement in the discussion then escalate it to the accountable person or the expert of this field to decide.
In the discussion we need to make sure that every argument has been heard and there is no winner or loser. A discussion shouldn't be about ego.

## Disagree and Commit
It is not always necessary that everyone agrees with everything and everyone else in order to commit to the task and do our best. We should discuss it and present our concerns during the discussion, but once committed we ought to deliver the highest quality work, especially in broader and shared tasks.

We shouldn't sabotage our features just because we don't agree about them.

"Diversity in counsel, unity in command" – attributed to Cyrus the Great, Persian king in the 6th century BCE on why he was successful

## Raise the flag
If we feel that something is wrong, we should not be afraid to raise the flag and speak about it.
We have talk about the things that we don't like. Everyone is equally important for us.
