Treat others as you wish to be treated.

## Trust and Cooperation

## Autonomy
Each member of the team is the owner of their tasks. Together, with the accountable person, ensure that the solution of the task is aligned to the goals. They are responsible for ensuring that the solution meets the quality and the standards needed, determining when and how best to involve others.

It is ok to disagree in a discussion. A healthy culture of controversy includes that everyone's views are equally valid and valuable. Although the person who works on the task gets to have the absolute right to stop the argument at any time.

## Disagree and Commit
It is not always necessary that everyone agrees with everything and everyone else in order to commit to the task. We should discuss it and present our concerns during the discussion, but once committed we ought to deliver the highest quality work, specially in broader and shared tasks.

## Raise the flag
If we feel that something is wrong, we should not be afraid to raise the flag and speak about it. 
We have talk about the things that we don't like. Everyone is equally important for us.
